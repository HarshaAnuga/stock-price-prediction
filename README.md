  # Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future values of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. This project gives the estimation of the price of a companyâ€™s stock based on the history and helps the stakeholders to either invest on the stock or to take away their stock from the company. In this project, only Open price is considered for processing.
